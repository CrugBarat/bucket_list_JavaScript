# Bucket & Spade List

A basic bucket list app using:

**Programming Language**: JavaScript

**Markup/Styling**: HTML5/CSS3

Using JavaScript, the bucket list can dynamically add visited resorts to a list. The list uses flex. The form can be dynamically toggled on/off. This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

# Brief

Your task is to create a front-end JavaScript application that allows users to input items and see them displayed in a list. Choose a theme for the application. Users should be able to enter values for different properties relating to the theme and see them displayed below.

**MVP**

- Create a form in HTML with inputs for relevant data
- When the form is submitted, access the data from the form in the form’s submit event object
- Create a list in HTML
- Append the submitted data to the list
- Add a “Delete All” <button> which clears all of the list items from the list

**Extensions**

- Refactor your code, extracting helper functions with single responsibility to keep each function small and readable
- Experiment with adding a new form input and experimenting with a new <input> type
- Style your application with CSS
